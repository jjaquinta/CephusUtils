# CephusUtils
Utilities for the Cephus Engine RPG.

There are mostly provided as examples as they rely on an outside library, not supplied. If people have a strong interest and running them, let me know, and I'll see if I can make the minimum of the library available.

Probably of most interest are the json files that contain various data elements of the game in a structured format. Those are the most re-uable across different programming languages.
